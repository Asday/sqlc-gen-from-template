# Languages and Database Libraries

To use a template, copy the respective file into your repo, set it in the `sqlc.yaml` and commit it. Don't hesitate to adjust it to your needs. Every project has different requirements.

If you come up with a template for a new language or database library, please contribute it, even if it is not perfect. It might be a good starting point for someone else.
